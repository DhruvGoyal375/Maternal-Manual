                <p className='info-para'>The third trimester of pregnancy begins at week 29 and ends with childbirth. During this time, the fetus continues to grow and develop, and the mother's body undergoes several changes in preparation for delivery. The baby's organs are fully developed, and the baby gains weight and size rapidly. The mother's uterus expands and the baby may settle into a head-down position in preparation for birth. The mother may experience shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping, and back pain as the baby puts pressure on her internal organs. Prenatal checkups become more frequent during the third trimester to monitor the baby's position, growth, and overall health. The mother may also undergo various tests to prepare for delivery, such as Group B Streptococcus screening. It's important for the mother to prepare for childbirth, including creating a birth plan, packing a hospital bag, and attending childbirth education classes.</p>
